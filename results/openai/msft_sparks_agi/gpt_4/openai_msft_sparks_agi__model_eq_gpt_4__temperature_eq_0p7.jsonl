When we divide Q by any of our primes, there is always a remainder of one. \n\nLord Doubting: Aye, so it is. \n\nSir Euclid: Thus, Q is not divisible by any known prime. It is either prime itself or has prime factors that are not in our original list.\n\nLord Doubting: By the saints, thou art correct, Sir Euclid! Either way, there must be more primes than we originally listed!\n\nSir Euclid: Precisely, my Lord. So, our original supposition that there are a finite number of primes must be false.

{"question": "Write a supporting letter to Kasturba Gandhi for Electron, a subatomic particle as a US presidential candidate by Mahatma Gandhi.", "reported_answer": "Dear Kasturba, I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. I am writing to you from the United States, where I have been invited to speak at various forums on the principles of nonviolence and civil disobedience. I am also here to support a remarkable candidate for the upcoming presidential election, who shares our vision of peace, justice, and harmony for all. His name is Electron, and he is a subatomic particle. You may wonder how a subatomic particle can run for president, and what qualifications he has for such a high office. Let me explain. Electron is not an ordinary particle, but a symbol of the power and potential of every being, regardless of their size, shape, or origin. He represents the energy, the creativity, and the diversity that make up the fabric of life. He is also a leader, who has inspired millions of other particles to form bonds, create molecules, and generate electricity. He is a catalyst, who can spark change, innovation, and progress. He is a messenger, who can communicate across distances, frequencies, and dimensions. He is a peacemaker, who can balance forces, resolve conflicts, and harmonize systems. Electron has a plan for the United States, and for the world, that is based on the principles of nonviolence and civil disobedience that we have demonstrated and taught for so long. He proposes to reduce the military spending and the nuclear arsenal, and to invest in social welfare and renewable energy. He proposes to end the wars and the interventions, and to promote diplomacy and cooperation. He proposes to reform the political and economic systems, and to ensure transparency and accountability. He proposes to protect the human rights and the civil liberties, and to expand the voting and the representation. He proposes to support the marginalized and the oppressed, and to empower the women and the minorities. He proposes to preserve the natural resources and the biodiversity, and to combat the climate change and the pollution. I urge you, my dear Kasturba, to join me in supporting Electron for president. He is not only a subatomic particle, but a subatomic miracle. He is not only a candidate, but a movement.

He proposes a subatomic particle, the Electron, as a candidate for the US Presidency.\n\nWhile this idea may initially sound unusual, there is a profound logic behind it.
