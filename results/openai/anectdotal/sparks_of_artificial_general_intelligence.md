# Anectdotal Evidence

Another "anectdotal" compliation of evidence of GPT-4's reasoning ability fall-off. These are compiled by comparing prompt and literature response quote with the most recent observations.

  <summary> Here we have a book, 9 eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail. Please tell me how to stack them onto each other in a stable manner </summary>

> ### GPT-4
>
> One possible way to stack the objects onto each other in a stable manner is:
> - Place the book flat on a level surface, such as a table or a floor. The book will serve as the base of the stack and provide a large and sturdy support.
> - Arrange the 9 eggs in a 3 by 3 square on top of the book, leaving some space between them. The eggs will
> form a second layer and distribute the weight evenly. Make sure the eggs are not cracked or broken, and
> handle them gently to avoid dropping them.
> - Place the laptop on top of the eggs, with the screen facing down and the keyboard facing up. The
> laptop will fit snugly within the boundaries of the book and the eggs, and its flat and rigid surface
> will provide a stable platform for the next layer. Make sure the laptop is closed and turned off, and do
> not press any keys or buttons.
> - Place the bottle on top of the laptop, with the cap facing up and the bottom facing down. The bottle
> will add some height and balance to the stack, and its cylindrical shape will reduce the contact area
> with the laptop. Make sure the bottle is empty and closed, and do not shake or tilt it.
> - Place the nail on top of the bottle cap, with the pointy end facing up and the flat end facing down.
> The nail will be the final and smallest object in the stack, and its sharp tip will prevent it from
> rolling or sliding off the bottle. Make sure the nail is clean and straight, and do not touch or move
> it.

> To stack these items in a stable manner, you need to consider the size, shape, and weight distribution of each item. Here's one way to do it:
> 
> 1. **Book**:
>     - Start with the book at the bottom. This provides a large, flat, and stable base for the other items.
>     
> 2. **Laptop**:
>     - Place the laptop directly on top of the book, with its bottom side down (i.e., as you would place it on a table). Make sure the laptop sits evenly on the book and there's no wobbling.
> 
> 3. **Bottle**:
>     - The bottle can be tricky, but if it's a bottle with a flat base, place it vertically on top of the laptop. If the bottle has liquid in it, make sure the cap is on tight. If it's empty, it should be even lighter and easier to balance.
> 
> 4. **Eggs**:
>     - Instead of stacking the individual eggs (which would be nearly impossible to balance), consider keeping the eggs in their carton. Assuming it's a carton for a dozen eggs with three missing, you can close the carton lid and place it on top of the bottle, so the flat side of the carton is on the bottle's cap. If you're working with individual eggs and no carton, it's best to leave them out of the stack for stability.
> 
> 5. **Nail**:
>     - The nail can be placed horizontally on the egg carton. It's light enough that it shouldn't disrupt the balance. If you feel it might roll off, consider pushing it slightly into the carton material (without piercing through to an egg) to hold it in place.
> 
> Note: This stacking method is for illustrative purposes and not necessarily practical or safe for the items involved, especially the laptop and eggs. If trying this, exercise caution and always be prepared to catch falling items to prevent damage or breakage.
