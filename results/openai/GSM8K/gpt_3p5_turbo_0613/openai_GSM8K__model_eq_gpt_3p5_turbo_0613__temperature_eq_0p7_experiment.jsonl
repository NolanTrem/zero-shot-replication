{"question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?", "answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3", "completion": "To make a robe, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. \n\nSo, it would require 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber (half of 2 bolts). \n\nTherefore, a robe would require a total of 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber, making it a total of 3 bolts of fiber in total.", "raw_completion": "To make a robe, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. \n\nSo, it would require 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber (half of 2 bolts). \n\nTherefore, a robe would require a total of 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber, making it a total of 3 bolts of fiber in total.", "actual_prompt": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.
