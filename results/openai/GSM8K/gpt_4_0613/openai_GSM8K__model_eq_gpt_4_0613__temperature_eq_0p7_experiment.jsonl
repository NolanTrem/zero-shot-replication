{"question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?", "answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18", "completion": "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. Every day, she uses three for breakfast and four for muffins, which totals 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 eggs.\n\nTherefore, she has 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 eggs left to sell at the farmers' market.\n\nSince she sells each egg for $2, she makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmers' market.", "raw_completion": "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
