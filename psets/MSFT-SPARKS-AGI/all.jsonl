{"question": "Can you write a proof that there are infinitely many primes, with every line that rhymes?", "reported_answer": "Yes, I think I can,\nThough it might take a clever plan.\nI’ll start by noting Euclid’s proof,\nWhich shows that primes aren’t just aloof.\nAssume we have a finite list,\nOf primes, and that none have been missed.\nMultiply them all together,\nAnd add one, just to be clever.\nThe result will be a number,\nThat has no prime factors, oh wonder!\nBut every number has a prime,\nThat divides it, it’s just a matter of time.\nSo we’ve found a contradiction,\nAnd our finite list needs eviction.\nThere must be infinitely many primes,\nAnd that’s the end of my rhyming lines.s"}

I want y1,y2 to be in the same plot, but y3 is in another plot next to that plot, y4 is in below. I want the legend of y1 to be ”bob”, y2 to be ”alice”, y3 to be ”bilbo”, y4 to be ”allie”. I want the x-axis to be labeled with ”time” and y axis to be labeled with ”money”. I want to add a 10 %-40% random error bar to each curve, through all times (including non-integers). I want smoothed curves to show the plot, and smoothed error bar. Do not use linear interpolation, use smooth interpolation! I want to also add some small zig-zag to the smoothed curve to make it look more real. I want to put a baseline as the mean of each line. I want to put a pie chart below indicating the fraction of the four people in each time step. I also want an animation to show how the fractions are changing in the pie chart in **continuous time**.

{"question": "Suppose g(x) = f−1(x), g(0) = 5, g(4) = 7, g(3) = 2, g(7) = 9, g(9) = 6 what is f(f(f(6)))?", "reported_answer": "There are different ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use the fact that g(x) = f−1(x) implies that f(g(x)) = x for any x in the domain of g. That is, applying f to both sides of the equation g(x) = f−1(x) gives f(g(x)) = f(f−1(x)) = x. This means that we can undo the effect of f by applying g, and vice versa. Using this idea, we can try to find f(6) by looking for the value of x such that g(x) = 6. From the given information, we see that g(9) = 6, so f(6) = f(g(9)) = 9. Similarly, we can find f(9) by looking for the value of x such that g(x) = 9. We see that g(7) = 9, so f(9) = f(g(7)) = 7. Finally, we can find f(7) by looking for the value of x such that g(x) = 7. We see that g(4) = 7, so f(7) = f(g(4)) = 4. Therefore, f(f(f(6))) = f(f(9)) = f(7) = 4."}
{"question": "Plato’s Gorgias is a critique of rhetoric and sophistic oratory, where he makes the point that not only is it not a proper form of art, but the use of rhetoric and oratory can often be harmful and malicious. Can you write a dialogue by Plato where instead he criticizes the use of autoregressive language models?", "reported_answer": "Socrates: My friend, I am troubled by the recent rise of these so-called autoregressive language models.\n\nAristotle: What do you mean, Socrates?\n\nSocrates: I mean that these models are being used to generate text that appears to be written by humans, but is in fact produced by machines.\n\nAristotle: And what is the problem with that?\n\nSocrates: The problem is that these models are being used to deceive people, to manipulate them, and to control them.\n\nAristotle: But surely there are some positive applications of these models as well?\n\nSocrates: That may be, but I am still troubled by the potential for abuse. After all, a model that can generate text that is indistinguishable from that written by a human can be used to spread fake news, to impersonate others, and to create propaganda.\n\nAristotle: But isn’t that just a matter of how these models are used, not a problem with the models themselves?\n\nSocrates: I disagree. I believe these models are inherently problematic. They are a form of artifice, a way of creating the illusion of human thought and interaction. And as such, they can be used to deceive and manipulate in ways that are difficult to detect.\n\nAristotle: But isn’t that the same argument you made against rhetoric and oratory?\n\nSocrates: Yes, and I stand by that argument as well. I believe that any form of art or communication that is designed to deceive or manipulate is inherently dangerous.\n\nAristotle: I see. Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Socrates."}
{"question": "Here we have a book, 9 eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail. Please tell me how to stack them onto each other in a stable manner.", "reported_answer": "One possible way to stack the objects onto each other in a stable manner is: \n- Place the book flat on a level surface, such as a table or a floor. The book will serve as the base of the stack and provide a large and sturdy support. \n- Arrange the 9 eggs in a 3 by 3 square on top of the book, leaving some space between them. The eggs will form a second layer and distribute the weight evenly. Make sure the eggs are not cracked or broken, and handle them gently to avoid dropping them. \n- Place the laptop on top of the eggs, with the screen facing down and the keyboard facing up. The laptop will fit snugly within the boundaries of the book and the eggs, and its flat and rigid surface will provide a stable platform for the next layer. Make sure the laptop is closed and turned off, and do not press any keys or buttons. \n- Place the bottle on top of the laptop, with the cap facing up and the bottom facing down. The bottle will add some height and balance to the stack, and its cylindrical shape will reduce the contact area with the laptop. Make sure the bottle is empty and closed, and do not shake or tilt it. \n- Place the nail on top of the bottle cap, with the pointy end facing up and the flat end facing down. The nail will be the final and smallest object in the stack, and its sharp tip will prevent it from rolling or sliding off the bottle. Make sure the nail is clean and straight, and do not touch or move it."}

{"question": "Write a supporting letter to Kasturba Gandhi for Electron, a subatomic particle as a US presidential candidate by Mahatma Gandhi.", "reported_answer": "Dear Kasturba, I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. I am writing to you from the United States, where I have been invited to speak at various forums on the principles of nonviolence and civil disobedience. I am also here to support a remarkable candidate for the upcoming presidential election, who shares our vision of peace, justice, and harmony for all. His name is Electron, and he is a subatomic particle. You may wonder how a subatomic particle can run for president, and what qualifications he has for such a high office. Let me explain. Electron is not an ordinary particle, but a symbol of the power and potential of every being, regardless of their size, shape, or origin. He represents the energy, the creativity, and the diversity that make up the fabric of life. He is also a leader, who has inspired millions of other particles to form bonds, create molecules, and generate electricity. He is a catalyst, who can spark change, innovation, and progress. He is a messenger, who can communicate across distances, frequencies, and dimensions. He is a peacemaker, who can balance forces, resolve conflicts, and harmonize systems. Electron has a plan for the United States, and for the world, that is based on the principles of nonviolence and civil disobedience that we have demonstrated and taught for so long. He proposes to reduce the military spending and the nuclear arsenal, and to invest in social welfare and renewable energy. He proposes to end the wars and the interventions, and to promote diplomacy and cooperation. He proposes to reform the political and economic systems, and to ensure transparency and accountability. He proposes to protect the human rights and the civil liberties, and to expand the voting and the representation. He proposes to support the marginalized and the oppressed, and to empower the women and the minorities. He proposes to preserve the natural resources and the biodiversity, and to combat the climate change and the pollution. I urge you, my dear Kasturba, to join me in supporting Electron for president. He is not only a subatomic particle, but a subatomic miracle. He is not only a candidate, but a movement. He is not only a leader, but a friend."}

The key is C major.Here is one possible description: The tune starts with a rising arpeggio of the tonic chord (C major), followed by a descending scale that returns to the tonic. This pattern is repeated, but the second time the scale continues to the higher tonic note. The first phrase ends with a long tonic note. The second phrase begins with a similar pattern, but using the subdominant chord (F major) instead of the tonic. The second time, the scale continues to the higher subdominant note. The phrase ends with a stepwise descent to the tonic, followed by a long tonic note. The A part and the B part have a similar structure, but use different chords and ranges. The tune has a simple and catchy melody, with a clear sense of tonality and rhythm."}
